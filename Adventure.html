    <br>
   The word <ins style="Color: Blue">‘adventure’</ins> usually has positive connotations. Though it may be challenging, an adventure usually makes us feel excited and energized.

   There are many different types of adventure. It might be argued that even something that other people might think is ordinary is an adventure, if it makes us feel challenged and excited. For instance, an adventure might be:
    <ul>
    <li>Climbing a mountain</li>
    <li>Learning a new language</li>
    <li>Traveling to a new country</li>
    <li>Going to the top of a tall building in the city</li>
    <li>Going white water rafting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    <h5> If you want other <mark>peoples</mark> advice then,according to people adventure is-</h5>
    <ol type="I">
      <li><p>Prathibha --> The term adventure is in a sense value neutral. An adventure can be <ins>frightening</ins>, or it can be great. It can cause <ins>pain</ins>, or produce <ins>joy</ins>. It can end badly or well. But you never experience an adventure unchanged. In fact, adventure is all about change. Its about growth. And growth is the core of life.</p></li>
      <li><p>Stan Hayward --> Above all, adventure mean moving into the <mark>unknown</mark>.

             It means you are choosing to do, or being forced to do something that you are not sure how to deal with.
        <br>
       <ul>
         <li>It might be that you are risking your <ins>life and limb</ins>.</li>
         <li>It might be that you risk your <mark>livelihood</mark>.</li>
         <li>It might be that you risk your <big>relationships</big>.</li>
         <li>It might be that you risk your <mark>beliefs</mark>.</li>
      </ul>
             Whatever, the consequence of taking the risk means that you are wiser about yourself than you were before. If you survive.

             Assuming you do survive then even if you failed to deal with the situation, you will have learnt the pitfalls of the event itself, and your own shortcomings.

</p></li>
      
    
    
    <br>
    <li><p>Rohan Khedkar --> Adventure is about going out of your comfort zone to open yourself up to the experiences and beauty that life gives you, no matter what path you choose to go on.</p></li>
      <li><p>Travis Snelling --> The definition of adventure is <ins>personal</ins>, like a fingerprint unique to each one of us. At its core, the spirit of adventure is being curious and courageous enough to try something new, go somewhere different or wander into that uncomfortable area between the familiar and the wild, mentally or physically. The key is to listen to your younger self, your inner explorer who saw the world as a great, big <mark>mysterious</mark> place full of wonder, and never stop venturing into the unknown.</p></li>
      <li><p>Charles Bollmann --> To me, adventure means<ins> enjoying life to the fullest, while at the same time using common sense.</ins></p></li>
      
      <li><p>Ritul Jain --> According to me , adventure is something ,which makes your life worth living.
        <ul>
        <li>Finding your passion is an adventure.</li>
        <li>Achieving your greatest dream is adventure.</li>
        <li>Living for someone else is adventure.</li>
        <li>Making a dent in the universe is adventure.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
             When you feel something is missing from your life , u are earning good , but still not happy, think a little you ll get to know , u are missing adventure
